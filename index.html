        <p>I am delighted to share with you that I have completed my SSLC (Secondary School Leaving Certificate) from Oriental Arabic higher secondary school located in Nagapattinam district-Akkur. The academic year I studied was 2014-2015, and I am proud to say that I scored a total of 429 out of 500 marks.</p>
        <p>My major subject was Arabic, and I scored an impressive 98 out of 100 in this subject. I am thrilled with my performance in Arabic as it is a language that has always fascinated me. Apart from Arabic, I also scored well in Science (97 out of 100) and Social Science (91 out of 100), which showcases my interest in these subjects as well. In English and Maths, I scored 65 and 78 out of 100, respectively.</p>
        <p>I had the opportunity to reside in the Oriental hostel during my 6th standard to 10th standard, which provided me with a unique and enriching experience. Living in a hostel has taught me the value of independence, self-discipline, and time management. I was able to focus on my studies and extracurricular activities, which helped me to grow as an individual.</p>
